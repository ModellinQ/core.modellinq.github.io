# Welcome to ModellinQ MutliPhysics Team

We are a team of PhD / Postdoctoral Scholars collaborating in developing Computational Methods in Materials science and Soft Matter Biopolymers. We here study Synthetic and Biopolymers useful for Industrial and Biomedical applications. We also take case studies of interest and publish open-source tools and  analytics.
