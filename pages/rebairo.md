# Hello Everyone!
I am glad to be a part of ModellinQ Core team. This is a new beginning.
Our aim is to put our long years of study into good use but our scope is broder than we thought!.
We started this venture with a simple motive of to provide Computational tools for Science graduate students. The idea has in-turn evolved and we are happy to announce our initial step of Incorporation has been done.
